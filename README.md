# FriendFinder
## Compatibility based dating app


FriendFinder is a dating app that matches users based on their compatibity scores. As shown in the demo below, the user will access the survey web page and will be required to input name and upload a photo. After the user answers the ten compatibility questions, the app will match the user to a compatible existing user from the friend's list. You can navigate to the current friend's list by going to [homepage/api/friends](https://fierce-ocean-44823.herokuapp.com/api/friends).

The app is designed to help users find compatible partners. The app currently uses questions to draw out the interests and traits of the user. A feature that I would like to include is a category that allows users to choose their gender preferences, so that the app logic can restrict the pool of potential friends.

*Please note the app uses Node.js and Express for its server environment.*. To use this app, please click on its web page(see *Accessing deployed app*).
